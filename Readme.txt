For the project I expanded an unreal top down starter project.
I created some sphere pawns and gave them a custom c++ ai controller
that can be seen in this repo source code. The controller uses an A*
node traversal method on a nav mesh in the level. I added plenty of 
obstacles to show the pawns traversing to their target, the player
Lastly I had the pawns draw a line through the nodes they would traverse
to the player to help visualize the path finding
